toRead
======

Main Usability
--------------

> 1st version - TB adapted

 1. Have a list of wanted books to read;

 2. Add a new book to the list and save it on an internal database;
    * Save option:
      - plain text;
      - barcode scan a book and add it to the 'toRead' list with one
        silky touch...;
    * Priorities;
    * Set a deadline for the book to be read and notify user within X
      days of approaching deadline;

 3. Remove an already read book from the list, mark it as : 'Read'
 (smt like that), save it to the already read books;

4. Mark a book as 'in progress' (smt like that) when the user is
currently reading it.

Future Updates
--------------

 1. Implement a Google Books Search and allow the user to SAVE it as
 it finds the good book (this will go along with the other save
 options);

 2. Allow the user to SEE MORE DETAILS about a book when barcode scans
 it but only?? saves the title;

 3. EXTEND the 'toRead' list to 'online' articles, somehow the user
 can be able to add it to its 'toRead' list directly from his browser;

 4. Classify 'things' to read as: books, arcticles, lectures, etc. and
 maybe allow user to organize them by CATEGORIES (e.g School,
 University, Work, Hobby, etc.) - this will obviously extend the
 database already owned;

 5. GeoLocation SERVICES? Maybe when the user enters a library,
 recognize and annoy him with making him check his 'toRead' list;

 6. SUGGESTION? Somehow to implement a prediction algorithm based on
 the previously read books in order to make interesting suggestions
 for the user to read: smt like: if the user used to read 'Economics'
 articles but did not read them for a long time now, maybe suggest him
 something from that category to read...etc...got the idea?
