toRead
======

Core
----

 1. Have a lists of books:
    * The default lists are: `to read`, `in progress`, and `read`;
    * Show the lists of books;

 2. Add a new book to a list:
    * Add by inputting the book's title, author, etc.;

 3. Move books between lists (e.g. move a book from `in progress` to
 `read`).

More GBS
--------

 1. Implement a Google Books Search and allow the user to SAVE it as
 they find the good book (this will go along with the other save
 options).

More BC
-------

> depends on More GBS

 1. Add a new book by scanning the book's barcode and searching that
 barcode online.

More N
------

 1. Other features moved from above: book priorities; book deadlines;

 2. Allow the user to SEE MORE DETAILS about a book when barcode scans
 it but only?? saves the title;

 3. EXTEND the 'toRead' list to 'online' articles, somehow the user
 can be able to add it to its 'toRead' list directly from his browser;

 4. Sync app with Amazon Search and Amazon WishList;

 5. Classify 'things' to read as: books, arcticles, lectures, etc. and
 maybe allow user to organize them by CATEGORIES (e.g School,
 University, Work, Hobby, etc.) - this will obviously extend the
 database already owned;

 6. GeoLocation SERVICES? Maybe when the user enters a library,
 recognize and annoy him with making him check his 'toRead' list;

 7. SUGGESTION? Somehow to implement a prediction algorithm based on
 the previously read books in order to make interesting suggestions
 for the user to read: smt like: if the user used to read 'Economics'
 articles but did not read them for a long time now, maybe suggest him
 something from that category to read...etc...got the idea?
